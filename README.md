# BeNext Bank Technic test
Technic test with a bank API

Bank account kata

Think of your personal bank account experience. When in doubt, go for the simplest solution

Requirements :
- Deposit and Withdrawal
- Account statement (date, amount, balance)
- Statement printing
- The expected result is a service API, and its underlying implementation, that meets the expressed needs.
- a basic UI implementing functionality only, no fancy design, 
- Nothing more,especially no persistence.
